## Overview

The Acceleration/Deceleration Oscillator (AC) is a momentum indicator that provides early signals about potential changes in market direction. Developed by Bill Williams as part of his Trading Chaos theory, it measures the acceleration and deceleration of the current driving force behind price movements.

What makes the AC particularly valuable is its ability to identify turning points before they become apparent in price action. By measuring the rate of change of momentum (essentially the second derivative of price), it can signal when a trend is losing steam even while prices continue in the same direction.

## Interpretation

The AC oscillates around a zero line, with positive values indicating acceleration and negative values indicating deceleration. The indicator is typically displayed as a histogram with color coding:

- **Green bars:** The current bar is higher than the previous bar (momentum is increasing)
- **Red bars:** The current bar is lower than the previous bar (momentum is decreasing)

### Key Signal Patterns

## Calculation

The AC is calculated in three steps:

<FormulaBlock>
  1. Calculate Median Price = (High + Low) / 2
  2. Calculate Awesome Oscillator (AO):
     AO = SMA(Median Price, 5) - SMA(Median Price, 34)
  3. Calculate AC:
     AC = AO - SMA(AO, 5)
</FormulaBlock>

The indicator essentially measures the difference between the Awesome Oscillator and its 5-period moving average, providing insight into whether momentum itself is accelerating or decelerating.

## Parameters

<ParameterTable parameters={frontmatter.parameters} />

## Returns & Output

The AC indicator returns a single time series of values representing the acceleration/deceleration at each time point:

- **Positive values:** Indicate the driving force is accelerating
- **Negative values:** Indicate the driving force is decelerating
- **Zero crossings:** Signal potential momentum shifts

The output array will have the same length as the input data, with initial values being `None` until enough data is available for calculation (typically the first 38 values).

## Example Usage

<Code lang="rust">
use vectorta::indicators::acosc;

// Your price data (High, Low arrays)
let high_prices = vec![/* your high price data */];
let low_prices = vec![/* your low price data */];

// Calculate AC with default parameters
let ac_values = acosc(&high_prices, &low_prices, 5, 34, 5)?;

// Use the values for trading decisions
for (i, ac) in ac_values.iter().enumerate() {
    if let Some(value) = ac {
        println!("AC at {}: {:.4}", i, value);
    }
}
</Code>

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Trend Confirmation
Use AC to confirm the strength of existing trends. When AC is above zero and showing green bars, it confirms strong bullish momentum. This can be used to time entries or add to positions.

### 2. Early Reversal Detection
Watch for divergences between price and AC. If price makes new highs but AC shows lower highs, it suggests the uptrend is losing momentum and may reverse soon.

### 3. Entry and Exit Timing
Following Bill Williams' rules:
- **Buy signal:** Two consecutive green bars above zero, or three consecutive green bars below zero
- **Sell signal:** Two consecutive red bars below zero, or three consecutive red bars above zero

### 4. Filtering False Breakouts
Use AC to validate breakouts. A price breakout accompanied by accelerating momentum (increasing AC values) is more likely to continue than one with decelerating momentum.

## Edge Cases & Errors

### Common Errors

- **Not Enough Data:** AC requires at least `slow_period + signal_period - 1` data points (default: 38 points) to produce the first valid value
- **Invalid Parameters:** Parameters must be positive integers with `fast_period < slow_period`
- **Empty Data:** Passing empty arrays will return an `EmptyData` error

### Special Considerations

- The indicator can produce many false signals in ranging markets
- Best used in conjunction with other indicators from the Williams system
- Color changes are as important as the actual values
