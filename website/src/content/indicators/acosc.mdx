## Overview

The Acceleration/Deceleration Oscillator (AC) is a momentum indicator developed by Bill Williams as part of his Trading Chaos theory. It measures the acceleration and deceleration of the current driving force behind price movements.


## Calculation

The AC is calculated in three steps:

<FormulaBlock>
  1. Calculate Median Price = (High + Low) / 2
  2. Calculate Awesome Oscillator (AO):
     AO = SMA(Median Price, 5) - SMA(Median Price, 34)
  3. Calculate AC:
     AC = AO - SMA(AO, 5)
</FormulaBlock>

The indicator essentially measures the difference between the Awesome Oscillator and its 5-period moving average, providing insight into whether momentum itself is accelerating or decelerating.

## Parameters

<ParameterTable parameters={frontmatter.parameters} />

## Returns & Output

The AC indicator returns a single time series of values representing the acceleration/deceleration at each time point:

- **Positive values:** Indicate the driving force is accelerating
- **Negative values:** Indicate the driving force is decelerating
- **Zero crossings:** Signal potential momentum shifts

The output array will have the same length as the input data, with initial values being `None` until enough data is available for calculation (typically the first 38 values).

## Example Usage

<Code lang="rust">
use vectorta::indicators::acosc;

// Your price data (High, Low arrays)
let high_prices = vec![/* your high price data */];
let low_prices = vec![/* your low price data */];

// Calculate AC with default parameters
let ac_values = acosc(&high_prices, &low_prices, 5, 34, 5)?;

// Use the values for trading decisions
for (i, ac) in ac_values.iter().enumerate() {
    if let Some(value) = ac {
        println!("AC at {}: {:.4}", i, value);
    }
}
</Code>


## Performance Characteristics

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of data points
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing intermediate calculations
- **Minimum Data Required:** slow_period + signal_period - 1 points (default: 38)
