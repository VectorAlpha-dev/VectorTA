  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Hull Moving Average (HMA) was developed by Alan Hull in 2005 as an attempt to create a moving 
    average that is both highly responsive to price changes and maintains smoothness in its curve. 
    Traditional moving averages face a trade-off between lag and smoothness - the HMA cleverly uses 
    weighted moving averages and square roots to achieve minimal lag while preserving a smooth line.
  </p>
  <p>
    The HMA accomplishes this seemingly impossible task by using a two-step process that first reduces 
    lag through weighted calculations, then applies smoothing using the square root of the period. 
    This innovative approach makes the HMA particularly useful for identifying trend changes early 
    while filtering out market noise that might create false signals.
  </p>

  <h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
  <h3>Trend Direction</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rising HMA:</strong> Indicates upward price momentum</li>
    <li><strong>Falling HMA:</strong> Indicates downward price momentum</li>
    <li><strong>HMA turning points:</strong> Often coincide with actual price turning points</li>
    <li><strong>Slope changes:</strong> Early warning of potential trend reversals</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Trading Signals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Buy signal:</strong> When HMA turns upward (color often changes to green)</li>
    <li><strong>Sell signal:</strong> When HMA turns downward (color often changes to red)</li>
    <li><strong>Strong trend:</strong> Steep HMA slope indicates strong momentum</li>
    <li><strong>Trend weakness:</strong> Flattening HMA suggests momentum loss</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Advantages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Minimal lag:</strong> Responds quickly to price changes</li>
    <li><strong>Smooth curve:</strong> Reduces whipsaws compared to other fast MAs</li>
    <li><strong>Clear signals:</strong> Direction changes are easy to identify</li>
    <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Works well across different timeframes and markets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="calculation">Calculation</h2>
  <p>The Hull Moving Average uses a unique three-step calculation process:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Calculate WMA of period n/2 and multiply by 2: <code>WMA1 = 2 * WMA(close, n/2)</code></li>
    <li>Calculate WMA of period n and subtract from step 1: <code>Raw HMA = WMA1 - WMA(close, n)</code></li>
    <li>Calculate WMA of the result using period sqrt(n): <code>HMA = WMA(Raw HMA, sqrt(n))</code></li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This process first enhances responsiveness by emphasizing recent prices (step 1), then removes 
    lag by subtracting the slower average (step 2), and finally smooths the result using the square 
    root of the period (step 3). The use of WMA (Weighted Moving Average) throughout gives more 
    importance to recent data.
  </p>

  <h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>
  <h3>Period (default: 16)</h3>
  <p>
    The lookback period for the HMA calculation. Unlike simple moving averages, the HMA uses this 
    period in a complex calculation involving half-periods and square roots.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Short period (9-16):</strong> Very responsive, good for scalping and day trading</li>
    <li><strong>Medium period (16-25):</strong> Balanced responsiveness, suitable for swing trading</li>
    <li><strong>Long period (25-50):</strong> Smoother curve, better for position trading</li>
    <li><strong>Note:</strong> Period should be at least 4 for calculation stability</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Hull recommended using a period of 16 as a good balance between responsiveness and smoothness. 
    The period must be chosen carefully as the calculation uses n/2 and sqrt(n), so very small 
    periods may cause instability.
  </p>

  <h2 id="returns">Returns & Output</h2>
  <p>The HMA returns a smooth, responsive moving average line:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Array of floating-point numbers</li>
    <li><strong>Length:</strong> Same as input data length</li>
    <li><strong>Values:</strong> Weighted average prices with minimal lag</li>
    <li><strong>Initial values:</strong> Null/undefined for approximately sqrt(period) values</li>
    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Smoother than price but more responsive than traditional MAs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="edge-cases"> Edge Cases & Errors</h2>
  <h3>Common Issues</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Minimum period:</strong> Period must be at least 4 for stable calculation</li>
    <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Requires approximately sqrt(period) bars to stabilize</li>
    <li><strong>Whipsaws:</strong> Can still occur in ranging markets despite smoothness</li>
    <li><strong>Overshoot:</strong> May overshoot during extreme price movements</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Best Practices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use period 16 as starting point (Hull's recommendation)</li>
    <li>Confirm signals with volume or momentum indicators</li>
    <li>Allow HMA to stabilize before taking signals</li>
    <li>Consider market volatility when setting parameters</li>
    <li>Use multiple timeframes for confirmation</li>
    <li>Don't use periods less than 4</li>
  </ul>
