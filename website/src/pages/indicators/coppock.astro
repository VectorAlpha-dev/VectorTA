  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Coppock Curve has a fascinating origin story. Edwin Coppock, an economist, was asked by Episcopal church 
    bishops about when to buy stocks after a major decline. After consulting with church members about the grieving 
    period for loss, he learned it typically takes 11-14 months to recover from bereavement. Applying this human 
    psychology insight to markets, he created an indicator that identifies when markets have "mourned" enough after 
    a bear market and are ready to recover.
  </p>
  <p>
    This unique psychological foundation makes the Coppock Curve particularly effective at identifying major market 
    bottoms and the beginning of new bull markets. While originally designed for monthly charts of stock indices, 
    modern traders have adapted it for various timeframes and markets, though it remains most reliable for 
    long-term trend identification.

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>The Coppock Curve calculation involves three steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Calculate Two ROC Values:</strong> Typically 14-month and 11-month rate of change</li>
    <li><strong>Sum the ROCs:</strong> Add the two rate of change values together</li>
    <li><strong>Apply WMA Smoothing:</strong> Use 10-period weighted moving average on the sum</li>
  </ol>
  
  <div class="not-prose bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg my-4 border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    <p class="font-mono text-sm mb-0 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
      ROC14 = ((Price - Price[14 periods ago]) / Price[14 periods ago]) × 100<br/>
      ROC11 = ((Price - Price[11 periods ago]) / Price[11 periods ago]) × 100<br/>
      <br/>
      Sum = ROC14 + ROC11<br/>
      <br/>
      Coppock Curve = WMA(Sum, 10)<br/>
      <br/>
      Where WMA weights recent values more heavily:<br/>
      WMA = Σ(Value × Weight) / Σ(Weight)<br/>
      Weights: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

      <li><strong class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Divergence:</strong> Higher low on Coppock, lower low on price</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-lg text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100">Signal Characteristics:</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      <li><strong class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Best on Monthly Charts:</strong> Designed for long-term analysis</li>
      <li><strong class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Major Bottoms Only:</strong> Not for minor corrections</li>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>Trading Strategies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Classic Bottom Fishing:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Wait for Coppock to fall deeply below zero</li>
        <li>Buy when curve turns up from negative territory</li>
        <li>Hold for major bull market move</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Zero-Line Strategy:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Buy on first cross above zero after being negative</li>
        <li>More conservative than bottom fishing</li>
        <li>Confirms new bull market is underway</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Modified for Selling:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Some traders use peaks above zero as sell signals</li>
        <li>Curve turning down from high positive values</li>
        <li>Not part of original methodology</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Multi-Timeframe:</strong> Use monthly for major trend, weekly for timing</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Advanced Techniques</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adjusted Parameters:</strong> Some use 13/26/10 for different markets</li>
    <li><strong>Sector Rotation:</strong> Apply to sector indices for rotation strategies</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmation Tool:</strong> Use with other long-term indicators</li>
    <li><strong>Relative Coppock:</strong> Compare multiple markets for strongest recovery</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Practical Application</h2>
  
  <h3>Strengths</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Excellent at identifying major market bottoms</li>
    <li>Based on sound psychological principles</li>
    <li>Simple, clear signals</li>
    <li>Very few false signals on monthly charts</li>
    <li>Time-tested since 1962</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Limitations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Primarily a buy-only indicator</li>
    <li>Very slow - not for active trading</li>
    <li>Less effective on individual stocks</li>
    <li>Can remain negative for extended periods</li>
    <li>Misses intermediate moves</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Combination with Other Indicators</h2>
  <p>The Coppock Curve works best when combined with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Moving Averages:</strong> Confirm trend direction after Coppock signal</li>
    <li><strong>Breadth Indicators:</strong> Confirm market participation in recovery</li>
    <li><strong>Sentiment Indicators:</strong> Extreme pessimism confirms major bottom</li>
    <li><strong>Volume Analysis:</strong> Rising volume confirms Coppock upturn</li>
    <li><strong>Economic Indicators:</strong> Fundamental confirmation of recovery</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mathematical Background</h2>
  <p>
    The Coppock Curve's mathematical elegance lies in its combination of two rate of change periods that capture 
    different aspects of market psychology. The 11 and 14-month periods represent the range of human grieving periods, 
    while their sum captures both shorter and longer-term momentum. The 10-period weighted moving average provides 
    smoothing while maintaining responsiveness to trend changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The use of percentage rate of change rather than price differences makes the indicator comparable across different 
    price levels and time periods. The weighting in the final moving average (10, 9, 8... 1) ensures recent values 
    have more influence while still considering the full lookback period, creating a balance between smoothness and 
    timeliness that's crucial for identifying major turning points.
