  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Aroon Indicator, developed by Tushar Chande in 1995, is a unique technical analysis tool that measures the time 
    elapsed since the most recent high and low within a given period. Named after the Sanskrit word for "dawn's early light," 
    the indicator is designed to reveal the beginning of a new trend.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike most indicators that focus on price or volume, Aroon focuses on time, making it particularly useful for 
    identifying when a trend is likely to begin or end. The indicator consists of two lines: Aroon Up (measuring time 
    since the last high) and Aroon Down (measuring time since the last low), both oscillating between 0 and 100.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>The Aroon Indicator calculates two separate lines:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Aroon Up:</strong> Measures how long ago (in periods) the highest high occurred</li>
    <li><strong>Aroon Down:</strong> Measures how long ago (in periods) the lowest low occurred</li>
  </ol>
  
  <div class="not-prose bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg my-4 border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    <p class="font-mono text-sm mb-0 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
      Aroon Up = ((Period - Periods Since Highest High) / Period) × 100<br/>
      <br/>
      Aroon Down = ((Period - Periods Since Lowest Low) / Period) × 100<br/>
      <br/>
      Where:<br/>
      - Period = Lookback period (typically 25)<br/>
      - Values range from 0 to 100
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Time-Based:</strong> Measures time elapsed rather than price movement</li>
    <li><strong>Dual Lines:</strong> Separate indicators for uptrend and downtrend strength</li>
    <li><strong>Bounded Oscillator:</strong> Values always between 0 and 100</li>
    <li><strong>Early Trend Detection:</strong> Designed to identify trend changes early</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Value Interpretation</h3>
  <div class="not-prose bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-950/30 p-4 rounded-lg my-4 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800">
    <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-lg text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100">Aroon Values:</h4>

    <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-lg text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100">Key Signals:</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      <li><strong class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Aroon Up &gt; 70 & Aroon Down &lt; 30:</strong> Strong uptrend</li>
      <li><strong class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Aroon Down &gt; 70 & Aroon Up &lt; 30:</strong> Strong downtrend</li>

      <li><strong class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Crossovers:</strong> Potential trend changes</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>Trading Strategies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trend Confirmation:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Buy when Aroon Up crosses above 50 while Aroon Down is below 50</li>
        <li>Sell when Aroon Down crosses above 50 while Aroon Up is below 50</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Extreme Readings:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Aroon Up at 100: New high just occurred, strong uptrend</li>
        <li>Aroon Down at 100: New low just occurred, strong downtrend</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Crossover Signals:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Bullish: Aroon Up crosses above Aroon Down</li>
        <li>Bearish: Aroon Down crosses above Aroon Up</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Consolidation Identification:</strong> Both lines between 0-50 indicate ranging market</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Advanced Interpretation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Parallel Movement:</strong> When both lines move together, indicates strong trending behavior</li>
    <li><strong>Three-Phase System:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Aroon Up/Down reaches 100 (new trend emerging)</li>
        <li>Stays above 70 (trend confirmation)</li>
        <li>Falls below 50 (trend weakening)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Divergence:</strong> Price making new highs/lows while Aroon fails to reach 100</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Practical Application</h2>
  
  <h3>Strengths</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Unique time-based approach provides different perspective</li>
    <li>Clear signals for trend strength and direction</li>
    <li>Excellent for identifying consolidation periods</li>
    <li>Works well in trending markets</li>
    <li>Simple to interpret with bounded values</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Limitations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Can give false signals in choppy markets</li>
    <li>Lagging indicator by nature</li>
    <li>Less effective in ranging markets with no clear highs/lows</li>
    <li>Period selection significantly affects signals</li>
    <li>Should be combined with other indicators for confirmation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Combination with Other Indicators</h2>
  <p>The Aroon Indicator works well when combined with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ADX:</strong> Aroon for direction, ADX for trend strength confirmation</li>
    <li><strong>Moving Averages:</strong> Use Aroon to time MA crossover trades</li>
    <li><strong>Support/Resistance:</strong> Aroon signals more reliable near key levels</li>
    <li><strong>Volume Indicators:</strong> Confirm Aroon signals with volume</li>
    <li><strong>Oscillators (RSI, Stochastic):</strong> For additional entry/exit timing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example Usage</h2>
  <p>Code examples will be available once the Rust implementation is complete.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Mathematical Background</h2>
  <p>
    The Aroon Indicator's mathematical elegance lies in its normalization of time. By converting the number of periods 
    since a high or low into a 0-100 scale, it makes trends comparable across different timeframes and securities. 
    The formula essentially measures how "recent" the last extreme price was as a percentage of the lookback period.
  </p>
  <p>
    The choice of 25 periods as the default is based on approximately one month of trading days, providing a good 
    balance between responsiveness and reliability. The indicator's strength is that it doesn't care about the 
    magnitude of price movements, only their recency, making it equally effective for volatile and stable instruments.
