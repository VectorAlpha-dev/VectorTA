# Rust Backtester Web Interface

This folder contains the Astro powered website for the Rust Backtester project.
The site provides a lightweight dashboard that visualizes indicator data and
strategy output generated by the core backtester. It can also load the
compiled WebAssembly version of the library to run calculations directly in the
browser.

Place CSV files exported from the Rust backtester inside the `static/` directory
to make them available for charts and examples. After running `npm run build`
the resulting `dist/` folder can be served as a static site alongside your
backtesting binaries.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
